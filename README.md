# Handling-imbalance-dataset-using-SMOTE

📔This project focused on addressing imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates, causing biased predictions. Using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique), I balanced the dataset by generating synthetic samples for the minority class. 
This improved the model's performance and enhanced my skills in data preprocessing and handling imbalanced data.

⚠️ **𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭** 
I ran into a big problem when working with machine learning models: unbalanced datasets. Real-world datasets frequently include one class with a disproportionately small number of samples compared to the other or classes. 
This results in biased model performance and poor generalization, particularly when it comes to predicting minority classes. The goal of my project was to solve this problem.


⚖️**𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐔𝐬𝐞 𝐒𝐌𝐎𝐓𝐄?**
One popular resampling technique for dealing with unbalanced datasets is SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique). SMOTE generates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between preexisting data points, 
as opposed to merely duplicating samples. By successfully balancing the dataset, this method enhances model performance and improves minority class prediction.

➤Models that favor the majority class due to imbalanced datasets are not appropriate for real-world uses such as rare event prediction, fraud detection, or medical diagnosis.
➤Fairness and dependability are increased when imbalance is appropriately addressed since it guarantees that the model learns significant patterns for both majority and minority groups.
